"""PromptRewriter — the Phase 3 core: a pure, deterministic transform over an
OpenAI-compatible `messages` list.

Normative per Phase 3 spec §3 (3.1–3.5). Free of any FastAPI/httpx/network
imports: it depends only on the stdlib (`hashlib`, `re`, `dataclasses`) and on
the contextmanager `TokenCounter`/`Message`/`DurableStore` types.

The headline invariant (§3.5) is PREFIX STABILITY / IDEMPOTENCY: a second pass
of `rewrite_outgoing` over its own output is a no-op for handle-ization (stubs
stay byte-identical), and handle-ization of message i depends ONLY on message i
(never on its neighbors). Both hold by construction here because:
  - `stable_id` is a pure function of (role, content);
  - the handle-ization decision (`counter.count_text(content) >= threshold`) is
    per-message;
  - already-stub content is detected and left untouched.
